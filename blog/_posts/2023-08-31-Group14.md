### Overview

From June to August of 2023, I had the amazing opportunity of interning for [Group14 Technologies](https://group14.technology/en/) as a Mechanical Engineering Intern. Group14 is a start-up based in Woodinville, Washington, dedicated to the "Electrification of Everything" through a novel silicon-based lithium-ion anode technology. Specifically, they have developed a new anode material which has five times the capacity and 50% more energy density than conventional graphite anodes. As an intern at Group14, I worked on mechanical design, process engineering, and industrial electrical engineering involving PLCs and relay logic. Though I cannot share the specifics to my projects, here you can read about a couple of the projects I worked on during my time at Group14.

Working at Group14's first industrial manufacturing plant, newly converted from a research lab, meant that increasing reliability and decreasing maintenance downtime was of utmost priority. The first project I worked on involved redesigning an inspection and maintenance device used to record footage, clean and repair a large pusher kiln. The previous design was heavy, unwieldly, and borke often, which doubled the furnace's down time and decreased material output. I utilized Autodesk and OnShape to CAD a more robust maintenance system, notably splitting up each function to a unique tool, significantly reducing both weight and complexity. Completing this project required constant interfacing with the maintenance, operations, and pusher kiln engineering teams in order to ensure all design requirements were met. 

Another cause for required pusher kiln shut downs is the necessity of cleaning a connected steam generator biweekly, to prevent silica accumulation. Too much silica build-up would clog up piping and reduce production quality significantly, decreasing in-spec yield rates. I introduced a continuous blowdown system to automatically clean the boiler, reducing the need of shut down to zero. The exhaust water of the steam generator also passed through a heat exchanger to preheat the inlet water.

In terms of relay circuit design, my main project was designing both the mechanical and electrical aspects of an automatic interlock and gas activation system for a passivation chamber. I developed a system which automatically released two separate gases via solenoid into a chamber when the chamber doors are shut closed. The circuit involves two solenoids, a hand off auto switch, signal lights, and a magnetic limit switch. It was my responsibility to source all of the parts, and work with the passivation chamber engineering team to ensure that all of their needs were met. 

Other projects I worked on over the summer included implementing current transformers to diagnose steam generator heating elements, relabelling the floor piping, and inventorying the factory's circuit breakers.
