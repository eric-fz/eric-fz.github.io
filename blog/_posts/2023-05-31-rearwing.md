### Overview

In the second semester of my freshman year, I was given the responsibility of designing, performing hand calculations/FEA, and manufacturing the rear wing mounting solutions for our Model Year 2023 car. I designed the two copper-colored goosenecks, as well as carbon fiber support rods connecting the side elements to the rear basket.

### Analysis

#### Hand Calcs
Rear Wing Gooseneck plates were sized manually to account for deflection in the lateral direction, in order to fit our rules requirements.

I also sized the carbon fiber rods for euler column buckling.

#### FEA
 The FEA of the goosenecks was conducted assuming 1600 N of drag force, 800 N of down force, and 200 N of side force. These are MY19 numbers, and are being used as placeholder values while the MY22 values are finalized through simulations. This linear 2D analysis was of the standalone goosenecks, independent of the larger rear wing assembly, partially as a training exercise and also to better understand how the rear wing is to supported by the underwing support rods, whose position will depend on a larger FEA. It is important to note that the distributed forces are not accurate and do not account for moments due to gravity, or larger down/drag forces acting on the rear wing as opposed to the car frame itself. This was solved using Nastran's Linear Structural Solver. 
 
I treated this FEA as a 2D problem with a 1/4" aluminum 6061 plate mesh collector for the plates. I fixed the holes through first connecting it with an RBE2 1D spider connection and fixing that mesh. As we plan to add rigidity to the system by connecting the two plates with wire, I created two RROD connections between the holes of the plates, as shown below.
