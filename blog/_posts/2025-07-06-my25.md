### Overview

![MY25Comp](/MY25Winning.jpg)

I led a 100-member team in designing, building, testing, and competing with MIT Motorsports’ first four-wheel-drive, decoupled suspension, electric race car, which placed 9th out of 86 teams at the 2025 Formula SAE Electric competition in Michigan. Using Confluence and Excel, I implemented critical path project management across 19 subsystems—from telemetry to battery to suspension—tracking and completing 255 key milestones, including design reviews, part fabrication, and system validation. I also launched the team’s autonomous division, helping define the full perception stack and collaborating with vendors to size and configure LIDAR and camera systems. In parallel, I secured over $200,000 in corporate sponsorships and organized STEM outreach events for high school students. Linked below is a killer youtube video showing off what it was like to be part of the team in this monumental year.

Starting a week after the 2024 Competition, I took leadership of the team - then with around 40 active members, to build the most ambitious car and organization in team history. With 270 incoming MIT students interested in joining the team, we successfully recruited 60, each member a Responsible Engineer for a critical subsystem for the car.

The MY25 design cycle was blistering pace, and I ensured every part of the car, whether it be structural, electrical, or controls, had a full DR process starting from design requirements to a fully optimized, reliable system. Key upgrades of this year's car include:

- A 554.4V four-wheel drive tractive system with in-hub AMK synchronous motors and custom packaged inverters, capable of 35kW at 18617 RPM peak.
- Custom 11:1 compound epicyclic gearbox, ISO 6 standard gears designed and simulated in KISSsoft.
- 554.4V watercooled battery. Molicel P45B cylindrical cells in a 132s4p configuration. 
- Separate PWM controlled inverter/battery and motor cooling loops. Custom aluminum 3D printed motor cooling jackets.
- Decoupled roll-heave suspension, with dampers and springs tuned at Multimatic's 4-post testing center in Toronto.
- Fully custom HV Battery Management System, Vehicle Control Unit, HV-LV, Sensor Node, Dash, Telemetry boards and firmware. First year with fully consolidated Low Voltage system (MegaLV). In-house HV and LV harnessing.
- Yaw rate controller based torque vectoring. Active tractive system power-limiting.
- Live IMU, shock pot, steering encoder, temperature, and state machine data that transmits to custom telemetry [website] (https://fsae-telemetry.mit.edu/dashboards)
- 40kg of mass savings, even with the increased mass of 4WD.
