Redmond STEM Center is a program I began in April of 2020. Under the 501(c)3 non-profit program Redmond Robotics, Redmond STEM Centerâ€™s mission is to create a youth community makerspace which acts as a hub for various STEM programs and host independent events and competitions. We focus on prioritizing the accessibility and inclusivity of hands-on STEM and career connected learning through a free membership program and outreach to underrepresented communities. Over the pandemic, our team has hosted webinars and innovation competitions and partnered with the DigiPen Institute of Technology to hold three STEM summer camps. As of April of 2022, our team had received a $65,000 sponsorship from Amazon and raised over $10,000 through separate fundraising efforts. We officially opened the physical STEM Center in the summer of 2022, and it continues running today under a new generation of studnet volunteers.
