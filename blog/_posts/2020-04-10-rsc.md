### Overview

Redmond STEM Center is a program I began in April of 2020. Under the 501(c)3 non-profit program Redmond Robotics, Redmond STEM Center’s mission is to create a youth community makerspace which acts as a hub for various STEM programs and host independent events and competitions. We focus on prioritizing the accessibility and inclusivity of hands-on STEM and career connected learning through a free membership program and outreach to underrepresented communities. Over the pandemic, our team has hosted webinars and innovation competitions and partnered with the DigiPen Institute of Technology to hold three STEM summer camps. As of April of 2022, our team had received a $65,000 sponsorship from Amazon and raised over $10,000 through separate fundraising efforts. We officially opened the physical STEM Center in the summer of 2022, and it continues running today under a new generation of studnet volunteers.

As suspension lead, I am managing a team of over 15 members to design the pull rods, ARBs, rockers, and steering, starting from first principles. I am also in charge of determining our suspension point geometry and choosing our tires, both vital for optimizing both lateral and longitudinal acceleration for the racecar, as well as maintaining driver comfort.

This highly iterative process requires constant communication with the chassis, powertrain, and aerodynamics teams in order to eliminate packaging conflicts and optimize the suspension system with ever-changing car parameters. Designing the suspension geometry began in early August, and the design freeze is in the last week of October. After October, I will be working mainly on validating my design through finite element analysis, as well as testing our control arms physically using an Instron tensile tester. Documentation of the entire design process is expected, to ensure proper knowledge transfer, to both current and future new members. Some specific innovations we are implementing this year include carbon fiber control arms, modeling suspension compliance/deflection, and writing a caster optimization script.

One challenge I’ve faced in the design process so far is determining our car’s camber sensitivity: how much a deviation from optimal camber affects cornering performance, and how that translates to competition points. The entire wheel packages team was blocked, as this sensitivity was required to determine stiffness requirements of the wheel packages, as any deflection from external loads impacts camber. Even though the design requirements deadlines rapidly approached, I made sure that every design decision was traced back to vehicle dynamics, either through Excel sheet calculations, or lap time simulations. In the case of determining camber sensitivity, I worked with the Simulations Lead to run a camber deflection vs. lap time sensitivity simulation in steady-state cornering. It was determined that 1 degree of camber change due to deflection equated to 3/575 points lost. This simulation has helped us contextualize our design requirements and set a wheel packages stiffness requirement to 1 degree in combined bump + cornering loads.

I've also had the opportunity to apply the formulas I've learned in my Mechanics and Materials I and Physics classes to size many of the suspension components. Most notably, I helped rework our suspension rod sizing calculations from first principles, as our push rods have buckled in previous years due to inaccurate sizing. First, I helped determine the maximum load cases each suspension rod faces, starting from measured values of maximum bump loading (3kN), acceleration (1.5G), braking (2G), and lateral load transfer. We utilized FSAEillumina's [excel spreadsheet](https://fswiki.us/Suspension_Forces), which uses matrix math to represent each control rod as a vector, and each load case as a matrix of three-dimensional loads. This spreadsheet takes in the coordinates of each control rod end point and tire forces, and outputs the maximum tension and compression each rod will experience. From this spreadsheet, I worked with the A-arms subsystem lead to calculate the yield strengths for different rod radii/material under bending, euler buckling, tension, and compression. The largest source of stress is from the pull rod, which isn't connected directly to the wheel packages, but to a connection on the A-arm itself. The vertical force caused by the pull rod creates a non-negligble bending moment on the upper A-arms, which we sized conservatively for, and are also planning on performing FEA for. Of course, these calculations cannot accurately account for possible manufacturing error, which could cause eccentric buckling, so each rod is sized with a 1.5 factor of safety, and we've developed a thorough manufacturing plan to ensure our machined components meet our tolerance requirements.
