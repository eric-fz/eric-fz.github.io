title: "IAP 2023: Mags the Chess Robot"
---
### Overview

In October of 2022, my friends and I decided to tackle a challenging personal project. With funding from MIT's ProjX grant and IAP minigrant, we designed, manufactured, programmed, and assembled an unbeatable chess robot. In February, we showcased our robot at MIT's [XFair](https://xfair.io/) to students and companies. The robot features a [core-xy](https://corexy.com/) gantry (similar to those of high end 3D printers, an electromagnet), a carbon fiber board, and 3d printed game pieces. My responsibilities included designing parts of the board in Onshape CAD software, soldering electrical components, and assembling and testing the final board. 

You can read more about the project in detail on my friend [Keiji's blog post](https://kogappa.com/projects/mags/), and watch it playing [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14NL_39Ftnc&ab_channel=KeijiImai)!
