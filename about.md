### Me

Hi there! I'm Eric, a first-year student at MIT studying mechanical engineering, robotics, and management. I also dabble in graphic design and video editing. Here you'll find a collection of projects I've worked on individually and with friends. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at [ericz@mit.edu](mailto:ericz@mit.edu).

### My hobbies

In an ideal world, I would love to spend time:
- playing tennis and soccer
- drawing
- practicing clarinet and piano
- building cool things
- *losing* at chess

With my free time so limited, I spend most of it losing at chess.
