### Me

I'm Eric, a senior at MIT studying Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Controls, Instrumentation, and Robotics. I like building things and teams both. My resume is linked [here](/EricZhou_Resume_2026.pdf). If you have any questions, feel free to email me at [ericz@mit.edu](mailto:ericz@mit.edu).

### Experience
In the summer of 2025, I worked on Starlink at SpaceX, as a Mechanical Engineering intern on the solar mechanisms team. The summer prior, I worked at a smaller space company, Varda Space Industries, where I helped develop payload mechanisms for their fourth ever reentry vehicle, Winnebago 4. My contributions launched into space in June 2025. In the 2024-2025 school year, I was Team Captain of MIT's Formula SAE team, where we placed 9th at the FSAE Electric Competition in Michigan, with our first four-wheel drive racecar. This was following my stint as Suspenion Lead in 2023-2024. I also have dabbled in research at MIT, working as an Undergraduate Researcher at the DeCoDE and D'arbeloff Laboratories.
