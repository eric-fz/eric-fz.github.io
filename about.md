### Me

Hi there! I'm Eric, a first-year student at MIT studying mechanical engineering, robotics, and management. I also dabble in graphic design and video editing. Here you'll find a collection of projects I've worked on individually and with friends. My resume is linked [here](/resume.pdf). If you have any questions, feel free to email me at [ericz@mit.edu](mailto:ericz@mit.edu).

### My Interests
At MIT, I am the Suspension Lead of MIT's Formula SAE team, MIT Motorsports. I also work with my friends on personal electromechanical projects. This past summer, I was an Engineering Intern for a battery technology start-up Group14 Technologies, reflective of my passion for deep-tech hardware startups and large-scale manufacturing.

### My hobbies

In an ideal world, I would love to spend time:
- playing tennis and soccer
- drawing
- practicing clarinet and piano
- building cool things
- losing at chess
